Proceedings will be published as a dedicated volume of the [*JMLR: Workshop and Conference Proceedings*](http://jmlr.csail.mit.edu/proceedings/) (this is not equivalent to a regular journal issue of JMLR).

The maximum length of papers is **16 pages** (i.e., as standard KDD papers) for regular papers, and **4--6 pages** for short papers. 

Submitted papers may be formatted according to either the KDD format or JMLR format for reviewing. Camera-ready papers should be in JMLR format. Note that camera-ready papers may be longer than the limits set for reviewing.

Please download the file [BIGMINE2016_template.zip](BIGMINE2016_template.zip) for the LaTex template and style file (or use the package directly as [provided by JMLR](http://ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/jmlr). Only the LaTex preparation system is supported for publication in the JMLR Workshop and Conference Proceedings series.

Following KDD main conference tradition, reviews are not double-blind, and author names and affiliations should be listed.

For accepted papers, authors will have the opportunity to revise their papers in response to the reviewers before final submission for publication in the proceedings.

The deadline for submission is: **May 16th 23:59PM**.

Submit your paper through the [BIGMINE 2016 Sumission Site](https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=bigmine2016).
