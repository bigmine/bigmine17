Big Data Mining (KDD BigMine-16)
5th International Workshop on Big Data, Streams and Heterogeneous
Source Mining: Algorithms, Systems, Programming Models and
Applications (BigMine-16) - a KDD2016 Workshop

KDD2016 Conference Dates: August 13-17, 2016   
Workshop Date: August 14, 2016   
San Francisco, California

KEY DATES
---------

Papers due: May 27th 23:59PM Pacific Standard Time   
Acceptance notification: June 13, 2016   
Workshop Final Paper Due: July 1, 2016   


SCOPE
-----

The goal of the workshop is to provide a forum to discuss important 
research questions and practical challenges in big data mining and
related areas. Novel ideas, controversial issues, open problems and
comparisons of competing approaches are strongly encouraged. 
Representation of alternative viewpoints and discussions are also
particularly encouraged.

We invite submission of papers describing innovative research on 
all aspects of big data mining. Work-in-progress papers, demos, 
position and visionary papers are also welcome.

Papers emphasizing theoretical foundations, algorithms, systems,
applications, language issues, data storage and access, architecture
are particularly encouraged.

We welcome submissions by authors who are new to the data mining
research community.


TOPICS
------

Examples of topics of interest include

* Scalable, Distributed and Parallel Algorithms
* New Programming Model for Large Data beyond Hadoop/MapReduce,
  Spark, Storm, streaming languages
* Mining Algorithms of Data in non-traditional formats
  (unstructured, semi-structured)
* Applications: social media, Internet of Things, Smart Grid,
  Smart Transportation Systems
* Streaming Data Processing
* Classification and Regression in Data Streams
* Heterogeneous Sources and Format Mining
* Systems Issues related to large datasets: clouds, streaming
  system, architecture, and issues beyond cloud and streams.
* Interfaces to database systems and analytics.
* Evaluation Technologies
* Visualization for Big Data
* Applications: Large scale recommendation systems, social media
  systems, social network systems, scientific data mining,
  environmental, urban and other large data mining applications.


SUBMISSION 
----------

Submitted papers will be assessed based on their novelty, technical
quality, potential impact, and clarity of writing. For papers that
rely heavily on empirical evaluations, the experimental methods and
results should be clear, well executed, and repeatable. Authors are
strongly encouraged to make data and code publicly available whenever
possible.

Proceedings will be published as a dedicated volume of the JMLR
Workshop and Conference Proceedings. This year we are accepting papers in two formats. Either
16 pages for regular papers (i.e., as standard KDD papers), or 4-6 pages for short papers.
See the website for more information regarding paper preparation.
